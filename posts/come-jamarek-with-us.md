We played Hawaii Public Radio’s Atherton hall in 2017, and we’re playing the Blue Note this coming Tuesday evening.

Will you come and enjoy the music, and also support my campaign for a better Honolulu? Our campaign has premium seats for the show; a $45 donation will get you a seat and will also support our grassroots efforts in the community. Seats are currently available the 6:30 pm show, but we can add seats for 9:00 pm if you prefer. Respond to this email if you’d prefer 9:00 pm.
