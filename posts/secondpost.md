I'm testifying in support of an amendment submitted by my Councilmember Fukunaga, for pedestrian safety and sidewalk improvements in Kalihi Valley. I'm a member of our neighborhood board and the co-convener of a committee we had established to consider pedestrian safety.

Kalihi Valley needs safe sidewalks. I, like my fellow neighbors, regularly have to walk in the street due to the absence of safe sidewalks. It's a dangerous and precarious situation, and we appreciate the intent of this amendment.

One additional note: the undeveloped sidewalks are often impassable because they have become parking for private vehicles. I'm hopeful that our Council will continue to develop parking management strategies that will meet the needs of our multimodal neighborhoods.

Mahalo to this Committee for considering our community's request, and a sincere thanks to Councilmember Fukunaga for introducing this amendment.
