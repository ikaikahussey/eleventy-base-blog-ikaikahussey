Not only is it fundamental to our economy, but it allows for remote islands such as ours to connect with the broader world. But aviation is a missing piece in our decarbonization efforts. I’m working on a new multi-stakeholder cooperative whose goal is to help with [drawdown](https://www.drawdown.org/) in general, and with decarbonizing air travel in particular.

Our plan is to develop a plant here on Oahu using the Air2Fuel technology created by [Carbon Engineering](https://carbonengineering.com/), based in Squamish BC. We’ve initiated conversations with the major stakeholders — airlines, labor unions, regulators, land owners — and we’re projecting a launch in four years.

Electric aviation is probably [25 years out](https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/electric-planes-promise-big-benefits-air-passengers-planet-ncna862001), so we’re projecting a 25-year lifetime for our plant.
