I first ran for office when I was 22 years <strikethrough>old</strikethrough> young. I was living at home with my family in Kaneohe. This was the old District 50; a conservative swath from Kaelepulu (Enchanted Lake) to Kaneohe Bay, going to Puohala. The incumbent was David Pendleton, who was a young dad and youth pastor. Nice family guy.
