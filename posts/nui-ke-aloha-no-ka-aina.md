![Hussey_OROEndorsement.jpg](http://ikaikahussey.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/4f9df-hussey_oroendorsement.jpg)</div></figure></div>I’m honored today to announce the endorsement of **Our Revolution Hawai‘i O‘ahu Chapter**.

Established by Bernie Sanders following the 2016 election, [Our Revolution](http://hello.ikaikahussey.com/t/i-l-bhjdyll-swuyyuv-y/) is dedicated to electing progressive candidates to public office.

I had the honor of helping to draft [Senator Sanders’ position on Native Hawaiian issues](http://hello.ikaikahussey.com/t/i-l-bhjdyll-swuyyuv-j/) in his 2016 campaign. I’ve been active in progressive politics since the mid-1990s and look forward to carrying those values forward into the Honolulu City Council as the Councilmember for District 6, stretching from Aiea to Makiki.

**Let’s take a stand for people power, not the power of money.** In his song for our beloved island Kaho‘olawe, Uncle Harry Mitchell wrote, “Kauli‘i mākou; nui ke aloha no ka ‘āina.” “*Though we are small, great is our love for the land.*” We may not have the deep pockets of the Super PACs, but together we are powerful because of our teamwork and our aloha for O‘ahu nei. So in the true Bernie spirit, [please support my grassroots campaign with a $1 donation](http://hello.ikaikahussey.com/t/i-l-bhjdyll-swuyyuv-t/). Your generous contribution will help us to put up more yard signs, send out our first mailer, and invest more in our awesome network of grassroots leaders from Aiea to Makiki.

Together we can win in August.
