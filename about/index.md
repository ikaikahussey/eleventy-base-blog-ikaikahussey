Aloha and hello:

I'm a social entrepreneur, organizer, and itinerant politician. It's nice to meet you.

I'm grateful to be alive and working in <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments/">an incredibly consequential decade</a>. Every day I think about the planet my children are inheriting, and it drives me to focus on the work and the world ahead.

I'm optimistic because I believe that social movements change the world. That's why I work with <a href="http://unitehere5.org/">UNITE HERE Local 5</a>, a union which focuses on building power for working people.

And I'm optimistic because of work I'm developing through <a href="https://hawaii.federated.industries">Federated Industries</a>, a social enterprise strengthening Hawaii’s economy through projects in decarbonization, circularity and local manufacturing. 

In the last decade, I worked on the idea that media and journalism can enrich and uplift the public debate. In 2006 I opened <a href="http://maoliworld.com">Maoliworld</a> as a social network connecting the Native Hawaiian community. I launched <a href="https://thehawaiiindependent.com">The Hawaii Independent</a> in 2009 to examine issues of interest to the Native Hawaiian and local community. And I founded <a href="https://summitzine.com">Summit</a>, a luxury magazine, in 2014 to present a Hawaii view on the world. I’m a former editor of Ka Wai Ola, co-editor of <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/258/A-Nation-RisingHawaiian-Movements-for-Life-Land">A Nation Rising: Hawaiian Movements for Life, Land, and Sovereignty</a>, published by Duke University, and have contributed <a href="https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/product/social-change-in-west-maui/">chapters</a> and essays to several publications including <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/hawaii-needs-you/">The Nation</a>.

There are amazing groups doing great work in our community, and I'm honored to serve on their boards: <a href="https://domesticviolenceactioncenter.org">Domestic Violence Action Center</a>, <a href="http://faithactionhawaii.org">Faith Action</a>, <a href="http://hanahauoli.org">Hanahauoli School</a>, <a href="http://kamehamehafcu.org">Kamehameha Federal Credit Union</a>, and <a href="http://hapahi.org">Hawaii Alliance for Progressive Action</a>. I'm an elected member of the Kalihi Valley Neighborhood Board.

I live in <a href="https://kalihi.org">Kalihi Uka</a>, and was raised in Kaneohe. My ancestral roots are in Kohala, Kona, Hilo, Ilocos Sur, Ireland and Italy. I play <a href="https://jamarek.band/">guitar</a>, piano, and am learning saxophone. Please get in touch – our best work will be done together.

Aloha,
Ikaika (he/him)
